# chromoSPA
## A Statistical Tool for studying chromothripsis

The purpose of this tool is to provide some basic statistical diagnostics for a given chromothripsis event, based on very simple spatial position and size information. From this information it is possible to infer properties of the mechanisms which cause chromothripsis.

## Cloning

Note that the /libs directory contains a submodule to an external library (written by me). To recover all required source code, you must use the --recurse-submodules command whilst cloning.

## Compiling & Running

Requires C++17 or higher.
